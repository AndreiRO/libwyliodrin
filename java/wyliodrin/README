0.	Before running 'sudo make build' please pay attention to this aspect:

	wyliodrin_wrap.c needs to know the location of jni.h.
	In my station, the jni.h is located at /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/include.
	Most likely the jni.h file has not the same path in your system.
	Run 'locate jni.h' to find the path to jni.h.
	After finding the path to jni.h. please modify the third line of the makefile,
	pasting the path to jni.h after the -I parameter.

1. 	After running 'sudo make build', run 'make test' to verify whether the java porting
	was successful or not. Running make test should print "It Works!". If you get
	any error, please let me know about it!

2.	I copied Wyliodrin.c and the rest of the files it needs in the WyliodrinCopy
	because I added a test() method that returns "It Works!". 

	I did not want to modify the original header only for this dummy method.
	I will modify the Makefile to use the original header after some testing on rp.
	Till then, the test() method is the only method that gives some guarantess that
	the Java porting was successful.

3.	It seems like when generating the -o files, gcc needs the -fPIC parameter.
	Otherwise I get this stupid error:

	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /usr/lib/libwyliodrin.so: /usr/lib/libwyliodrin.so: undefined symbol: create_inet_stream_socket
	at java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary1(ClassLoader.java:1965)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(ClassLoader.java:1890)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1880)
	at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:849)
	at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1088)
	at main.main(main.java:3)

	I ask permission to modify the original Makefile to generate the -o files
	using the -fPIC parameter. Please include your answer in the review.
